# This repository contains my submission finite state automaton (which plays Rock-Paper-Scissors) made in my second year (September 2022).

## The submission was part of a competition in the our batch to make a FSA that beats other FSA's in a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors.

## Task
- You are given the opponent’s FSA with n ≤ 30 states but not its initial state. You have to submit the
following files: 1. A program that outputs an FSA with m ≤ 1000 states and a fixed initial state such
that it beats the opponent FSA as many times as possible. We will simulate 10,000 rounds for each
possible initial state of the opponent FSA. 2. A file containing a single FSA which your batchmates
programs will be evaluated against. The better your test case, i.e. the harder it is to win against this
FSA, the greater your score.


## My Submission
- This repository contains my program `rps.cpp` that when given  as input, a finite state automaton(FSA) which plays Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) with an unknown initial state, outputs a FSA that beats it in as many rounds as possible.
- It also contains `fsm.txt` which is my test case to play the game with other batchmate's program.

## Results
- My program had 99.9% accuracy on the test cases.
